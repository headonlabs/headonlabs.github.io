          In this Privacy Policy, HeadOn Labs LLP (hereinafter: 'HeadOn Labs' or 'we') explains which personal data is
          collected when you use our websites and services. This includes the website of our company HeadOn Labs (<a
            href="https://headonlabs.com">headonlabs.com</a> and its subdomains), and the website of our cloud platform
          Fostrom (<a href="https://fostrom.io">fostrom.io</a> and its subdomains) (hereinafter: the "Websites") and our
          product Fostrom (hereinafter: the "Product"), (hereinafter jointly: the/our "Service(s)").
        </p>

        <p>
          We value your privacy and the protection of your personal data. Personal data will therefore be processed
          carefully and in accordance with this Privacy Policy and applicable laws and regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have any questions or wish to receive further information, please contact us at
          <a href="mailto:support@fostrom.io">support@fostrom.io</a>
          with the subject "Privacy Policy Concerns". We will respond to your request as soon as possible.
        </p>

        <h3>1. When does this Privacy Policy apply?</h3>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy applies to visits to our Websites and the use of the Product. If necessary, we make a
          distinction in this Privacy Policy between our Website and our Product.
          Also, this Privacy Policy only applies to processing of Personal Data by us as controller. If an organisation
          processes Personal Data of you through our Services, this organisation is the controller. We are then the
          processor. In that case, this Privacy Policy does not apply.
          This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites that are linked to our websites. We cannot
          guarantee that these third parties will handle your Personal Data in a reliable or secure manner. We recommend
          that you also read the privacy policies of these parties/websites.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Personal data</h3>
        <p>
          When we use the term "Personal Data" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information relating to you, which may
          include identifiers such as your name, identification numbers, location data, social identity and other
          details.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Personal Data Processing and Cookies</h3>
        <p>
          When you fill a form on our website such as when signing up or logging in, we may collect personal data (such
          as your name, email address, and phone number) and process it to facilitate providing services to you. We may
          also use GitHub login to authenticate you. In that case, we may collect your GitHub username, email address,
          and avatar. We may also collect your IP address and browser information to facilitate security and
          authentication measures.
          In case you sign up for an account on our services, we may send you emails related to your account and
          services. In case you sign up for our newsletters, we may collect your email address and name to send you the
          newsletter. We may use external email services such as Cloudflare or Postmark to send you emails. In that
          case, we need to share your email address and name with the provider. We cannot make guarantees about their
          privacy policies and hence encourage you to read the privacy policies of Cloudflare and Postmark. You can
          unsubscribe to newsletters at any time by clicking the link in the email. You may not be able to subscribe to
          important account-related emails as long as you have an account with our services.
          When you visit our Websites as a visitor, we may store cookies in your browser. When you login or sign up to
          our services, we may store cookies to identify your account. None of the cookies, at any time, are used for
          third-party tracking and analytics purposes. The cookies are usually set to facilitate security and
          authentication measures. We do not use any third-party tracking or analytics services that require us to set
          tracking or analytics cookies on your browser.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Payments</h3>
        <p>
          It may be possible to purchase subscriptions or enter into billing agreements to our Product for a fee. To
          arrange payment for our Product, we may use a third-party payments processor to facilitate the payments. We
          may need additional Personal Data to process payments such as the details of the credit/debit card, or details
          required by other payment methods.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Security</h3>
        <p>
          We protect your Personal Data by taking technical and organisational measures against unauthorised, unlawful
          or accidental access, loss, destruction or damage to Personal Data. We are constantly taking steps to improve
          data security. We use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt communications between you and our services.
          When we store passwords or secrets, we hash them using a strong one-way hashing algorithm and store them in a
          secure database, unless otherwise mentioned. We use encryption-in-transit and we also employ
          encryption-at-rest wherever possible. We ensure only the necessary persons have access to your Personal Data.
          Our security measures are regularly checked and evaluated.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Retention period</h3>
        <p>
          We do not keep your Personal Data longer than necessary for the purposes for which they were collected or
          used. We only keep the Personal Data for a longer period if this is necessary to comply with a legal
          obligation, such as a tax retention obligation.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Third parties</h3>
        <p>
          We do not sell your data to third parties. We may, however, engage third parties who process certain Personal
          Data under our responsibility.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Updates or changes to this Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
          The way in which we process Personal Data, and the composition of the data we process, may change over time.
          HeadOn Labs LLP reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. For that reason, we encourage
          you to check the Privacy Policy regularly to stay informed of such changes. We make commercially reasonable
          efforts to inform you of major changes. In this way we ensure that you are aware of recent changes.
