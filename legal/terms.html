        <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>

        <p>
          Payment may be made in advance per calendar month or year, or at the end of a billing cycle or as otherwise
          mutually agreed upon. Payment is due within 7 days after the invoice date, unless otherwise agreed upon.
          Whether any tax is applicable or included in the price (such as VAT or GST), will be indicated at the time of
          starting a subscription or billing cycle. Payment can be made through credit/debit card or other supported
          payment methods. Payments are non-refundable, unless agreed otherwise. In case of a subcription, if you cancel
          your subscription before the subscription elapses, no payment will be refunded, and you can use the Service
          until the subscription elapses. If you choose to cancel your billing plan, you will have to pay any accrued
          charges up until that point.
        </p>

        <p>
          If an amount that is owed is not paid within the payment term, you are in default by operation of law. If you
          are in default for more than a certain period of time as deemed by HeadOn Labs, we are entitled to suspend
          and/or lock your account temporarily. In that case you will receive instructions by email on how to meet
          payment and when your account will be re-activated. If payment remains behind, we are entitled to delete your
          account (permanently), including all data, settings and the like. HeadOn Labs is not liable for temporarily
          locking and/or suspending your account nor for permanently deleting your account due to late payment.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Termination</h3>

        <p>
          In addition to the other remedies available to HeadOn Labs, HeadOn Labs is at all times, at its sole
          discretion, without prior written notice or explanation and without becoming liable to you, entitled to:

          You are solely responsible for properly canceling your account, which you can do in the Service only. Any
          other form of cancellation is not accepted and therefore not processed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Either Party may terminate the agreement immediately upon written notice to the other party if:
        <ul>
          <li>the other party ceases to carry on its business;</li>
          <li>
            the other party breaches any material provision of the agreement (the obligation to pay for the Service is a
            material provision of the agreement) and such breach continues uncured for 30 days - or 7 days for breach of
            any payment obligation - after written notice of this breach;
          </li>
          <li>
            the other party becomes insolvent, admits in writing to its inability to pay debts as they mature, is
            adjudicated bankrupt, or makes assignment for the benefits of its creditors; or
            any proceeding under bankruptcy, or insolvency laws is commenced by or against the other party and is not
            dismissed within 30 days.
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          Amounts invoiced by HeadOn Labs prior to termination in connection with what is already properly performed or
          delivered in performance of the agreement shall remain payable in full and shall become immediately due and
          payable at the time of termination.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon any termination or expiration of the agreement in any way whatsoever, all rights granted to you hereunder

          Upon any termination or expiration of the agreement in any way whatsoever, it is your responsibility to copy
          any content you want to retain to a computer or any other storage device, before termination. HeadOn Labs is
          entitled to immediately delete all of your content from the Service upon termination. This information can not
          be recovered once your account is terminated.
        </p>

        <p>
          You are at all times responsible for any legal obligation to keep your invoices, even after terminating your
          account.
        </p>

        <p>
          All provisions which are meant to survive the termination of the agreement, including but not limited to all
